# binary-classification-w-tensorflow

This project focuses on binary image classification, a fundamental task in computer vision where the objective is to categorize images into one of two possible classes. To achieve this, two of the most popular and powerful deep learning frameworks, PyTorch and TensorFlow, have been utilized. The choice of both frameworks allows for the exploration of different approaches and optimizations in model development and training.

The system includes robust functionalities for data preparation and augmentation, which is crucial for improving model generalization and preventing overfitting, especially when working with limited datasets. Furthermore, the project incorporates a comprehensive evaluation of the models using key performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. This ensures a complete understanding of the effectiveness of the trained models.
